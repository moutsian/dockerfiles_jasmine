These are Dockerfiles for the jasmine tool. The Dockerfile_conda is big, in the Dockerfile_conda_small I am using a two-stage build. I have ZERO experience in containers so please do not use these files as best practice examples.
I've based my files on the example here: https://elearning.bits.vib.be/courses/introduction-to-docker/lessons/docker-recipes-build-your-own-images/topic/using-bioconda-for-bioinformatics-tools/
I have only tested them with the example run for jasmine for now.
